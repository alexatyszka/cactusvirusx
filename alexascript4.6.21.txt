Alexa's 4/6 talk script
{Slide 1}
Hello everyone, thanks for coming to this presentation. My name is Alexa Tyszka and I'll be talking about plant viruses today, particularly those that infect cacti, and how we need to get better at talking about them.

Cactaceae, or cacti, is a family of approximately 2000 species of desert-adapted plants. You may have heard of a group often called Christmas, or Easter, cacti, or maybe you even own some. They are members of the genus Schlumbergera. Rather than being desert-adapted, they grow a bit like air-plants in their native habitat in Brazil. My project stems from an accidental discovery of infections in our study plants.

It turns out that this infection is a virus, Cactus virus x, has been known and studied for over a century and is found in many species of cactus.

But! Many questions remain unanswered--we know very little about CVX. We set out to determine: how many strains or species of viruses infect species of cacti, and how many species of cacti are infected by this group of viruses, as well as try to find out how the virus is transmitted and to track the history of transmission. One obvious way forward is to find out the relationships among this group of viruses on different plant hosts, and that is the work that I'm focusing on today. 

When we looked at the relationships between the viruses we have right now, kind of like a family tree, the names are very confusing. Many of them were related more like distant cousins than twins, but they were all called "Cactus Virus X". The closely related members are named after different names for the same plant. This raises the question: what is Cactus Virus X? Of course, it infects some cacti, but the hosts do not encompass all cacti! This is one of the things that can be fixed, and needs to be. Currently, we name these viruses after the plant that it is first found in, regardless of whether that is the actual host. Many of these viruses have been found to co-infect their hosts, meaning that there is not a one-to-one ratio of plants to viruses. Viruses do not behave, and they don't really follow any of our rules. 

We also have some confusing names for related viruses -- essentially, the names of the cacti have been changed, but the names of the viruses have not. The problem with this is pretty clear to me, especially because many of these old names refer to the same species. 

Looking at the facts, what we found is that there are a few distinct groups of these viruses, which are related more to each other than to others. We can use some specific genetic cutoffs -- you must be this tall to ride -- to split the existing groups into Cactus Virus A through E. These can be subdivided into CVX A:1, A:2, and so on. This allows for us - if the need arises - to expand our names if - and when- we discover new viral samples. Instead of a researcher discovering a virus and naming it after a plant that it was found on by chance, we can instead name it for the characteristics it has. The world of plant viruses is vast and we are currently at the very tip of the iceberg. We barely know what is out there but we need to be prepared for what is. 

Thank you
